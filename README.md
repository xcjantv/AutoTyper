AutoTyper is a small application that allows you to easily and quickly insert text into any application by simply copying it to the clipboard and pressing a keyboard shortcut. The program runs in the background and waits for you to press the specified key, at which point it will automatically insert the text from your clipboard.

Installation:
No installation is required for this program. Simply download the AutoTyper.exe file and run it.

Usage:
To use AutoTyper, first copy the text you want to insert to your clipboard. Then press the F9 key, and the text will be automatically typed into your active application.

Uninstallation:
To uninstall AutoTyper, simply delete the AutoTyper.exe file from your computer.

Note:
This program runs in the background and may interfere with other applications that use the same keyboard shortcut. Please use caution when using this program, and make sure you are not accidentally inserting text into the wrong application.

Dev Note: For changing the shortcut key, simply change Keyname in line 33.
